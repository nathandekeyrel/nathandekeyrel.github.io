    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h3>This is going to be my portfolio website</h3>
    <p>
        So far, I'm not too familiar with web dev outside a class I took two years ago, but the hope is that I'm able to use Three.js to build a visually appealing, interactive webpage where you can see the projects I've been working on.
    </p>

    <h3>Here's a list of projects I want to complete</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Turn Hand-drawn Images to Functions</li>
        <li>Compiler</li>
        <li>Text Editor</li>
        <li>Implementation of the Linux Kernel</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These are "Milestone Projects" which will signify an increased understanding with each completing. I will be making a lot of smaller projects in-between,
        but these are going to be personally defining. Additionally, I've already made some cool projects outside of university. To note a few...
    </p>

    <ul class="completed">
        <li>a final grade calculator with a gui</li>
        <li>a keyboard macro using threads</li>
        <li>a discord bot to host competitions in an online game</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Although the discord bot is the biggest project I've worked on, also my first time coding on a team of international developers, I am going to keep it separate from my portfolio. This is because I was developing under my online username, and would prefer to remain anonymous in that community.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was a very humbling experience, ~month of developing and testing only for it to be used once. It worked perfectly, but the community we developed it for imploded about a month later and never did any follow-up competitions.

    <h3>Previous Courses</h3>

    <ul class="completed">
        <li>Logic Circuits</li>

        <li>Computer Systems</li>
        <li>Software Engineering</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I am taking both <strong>Web Dev</strong> and <strong>Advanced Web Dev</strong> this semester. The latter is a new class being offered; it's only offered in the fall, so I had one chance to take it and got the prereqs waved</p>
