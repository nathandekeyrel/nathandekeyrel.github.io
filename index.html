    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h3>This is going to be my portfolio website</h3>
    <p>
        So far, I'm not too familiar with web dev outside a class I took two years ago, but the hope is that I'm able to use Three.js to build a visually appealing, interactive webpage where you can see the projects I've been working on.
    </p>

    <h2>Here's a list of projects I want to complete</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Turn Hand-drawn Images to Functions</li>
        <li>Compiler</li>
        <li>Text Editor</li>
        <li>Implementation of the Linux Kernel</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These are what I'm going to call "Milestone Projects" (made that up right now haha). I will be making a lot of smaller projects in-between,
        but these are going to be personally defining. Additionally, I've already made some cool projects outside of university.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, a final grade calculator with a gui, a keyboard macro using threads, and a discord bot to host competitions in an online game.
        Although the discord bot is the biggest project I've worked on, also my first time coding on a team of international developers, I am going to keep it separate from my portfolio. This is because I was developing under my online username, and would prefer to remain anonymous in that community.
        It was a very humbling experience, ~month of developing and testing only for it to be used once. It worked perfectly, but the community we developed it for imploded like a month later and never did any follow-up competitions.
